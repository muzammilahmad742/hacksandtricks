<br/><br/>

   <b> 1.</b>Select a small website that you want to DDos attack.<br/>
    <b>2.</b>Find the IP address of the website. To find the IP address of a specific website just use the following command:

    <pre style="background: #575b5a;color: #fff; overflow: auto;padding: 1.8em;width: 92%;">ping www.example.com </pre>

    <b>3.</b>The IP address looks similar to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx<br/>
    <b>4.</b>Now type the following command:<br/>

    <pre style="background: #575b5a;color: #fff; overflow: auto;padding: 1.8em;width: 92%;">ping [ip address] -t -l 65500</pre>
<br/>
    <b>5.</b>Run the command for hours. If possible use multiple computers to run the same command at the same time.
    Now, when you visit the website after 2 or 3 hours, you will find the “website is temporary down” or “server unavailable” message.
<br/><br/>
    <b>Note:</b> You should have an internet connection with unlimited bandwidth. Otherwise, you lose all your internet bandwidth for performing the task.

    <b>11. </b>Uncheck the ‘Wait for reply’ check box.<br/>
